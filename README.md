### What's New ðŸ¥³

* Jun 2023, we released the implementation, scripts, checkpoints, and logs of our ICML'23 paper [UPop: Unified and Progressive Pruning for Compressing Vision-Language Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13741). UPop enables effective structured pruning on various multi-modal and uni-modal tasks. [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.13741.pdf). [[Code]](https://github.com/sdc17/UPop). ðŸš©
