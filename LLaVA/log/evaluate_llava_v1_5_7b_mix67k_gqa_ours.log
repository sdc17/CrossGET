Please make sure to use our provided visual features as gqadataset.org for better comparability. We provide both spatial and object-based features trained on GQA train set.
In particular please avoid using features from https://github.com/peteanderson80/bottom-up-attention since they were trained on images contained in the GQA validation set and thus may give false scores improvement.

Please consider using --consistency to compute consistency scores for entailed questions.
If you do so, please provide answers to all questions in val_all_questions.json.

Please consider using --grounding to compute attention scores.
If you do so, please provide attention maps through --attentions.
